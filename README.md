# TS-Node boilerplate

Here is my simple ts-node template I made for quickly starting new node projects.

## Quickstart

1. Have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Run ```npm i -g typescript``` to make sure that TypeScript is installed globally.
3. Run ```npm i``` to install the dependencies including TS-Node.
4. You're ready to start coding! Run ```npm run start``` and you should be able to see "Hello" being printed to the terminal.
